BIGDATA file, is a chess prediction dataset of 15 GB. too big to fit in colab ram (for compression treatment), so i had to use Chunk size in Compression, so the comparison wasn't clear and took too long.
LessBIGDATA file, is a NewYork taki dataset of 2 GB. Made the comparison correctly this time around but the data was of lesser size than i would have preferred.

to run the files, just get a Kaggle token (from profile -> settings -> Token) and download it, then choose it in the file picker at the start of the code.
